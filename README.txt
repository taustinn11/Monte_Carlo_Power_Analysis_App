Monte Carlo Power Analysis App

This app is meant to assist scientists or experimenters in powering their experiments. The long-term goal is to allow users to work with most frequentist hypothesis tests.

To do:
Determine a way to save the object created to then generate the plot - DONE
Figure out why changing the number of simulations in the app breaks it - DONE
Set an update button to update new preferences - DONE
Set a slider to choose n_reps - will speed up processing w/ higher n_sims # - DONE

Determine if numeric inputs for n_reps will be useful for power considerations for prop tests
Determine a way to only show specific menus based on whether the user chooses 2 or >2 samples
Figure out if generating the scripts to use in the server script can be saved separately
